 - Type of sales I am dealing with
   - Services. opsZero (Health, Financial, Enterprise companies that store sensitive data who need security, reliablility, and be able to ship fast)
   - High value, low volume, services. with inertia in the organization against it.
   - What I am not providing, how to do product sales for low value, high volume.
     - Thought I believe the process would be the same.
 - What is sales?
   - Sales is problem solving with the objective of getting people to pay you money to solve that problem.
   - What sales is not
        - It is not making people buy stuff. Most people wont buy from you. Period.
          - Of the 20% who respond to my sales inquriries maybe 4% convert.
          - Of the 20% who respond to my sales prospecting maybe 1% convert.

 - What are you selling?
   - Really dial it in.
   - Doing too many things will eat up your time and energy. If you can standardize then do it.

 - Two parts of sales
   - Prospecting
   - Closing
   - Prospecting is the process of talking to people to sell them your "vision".
     - What is the world you are selling?
     - What is an existing client
   - Closing
     - Is to make that prospect into a customer.

 - Closing
   - Lets start with the easy part. Closing.
   - There is huge intertia for people to not do anything.
     - Not doing anything is safe, you are the unknown.
     - Don't go in there with the assumption that you own the place, and you get a seat at the table. You have to earn that seat. And even then play hard to get, while delivering the value they seek.
   - Simplify pricing. Don't add random pricing and points where people have to think. Even if you are doing services keep things simple.
     - We basically have two price points.
     - Likewise, you will not be good at everything so the services you provide have to be specific. Don't try to be generic. No one wants to get plumbing services from Starbucks.
     - Being specialized is to your benefit. Creates a sense of trust and you are the expert.
   - Go to a meeting prepared
     - You have to go into a meeting PREPARED
     - The best method I found is the Challenger Sales
     - Dont be friends with your prospect
       - Don't try to woo them to you.
     - Like a good partner in life, a good vendor is also someone that challenges you. Makes you think about your assumptions.
       - If you keep telling them they are great, why do they need you?
       - Challenge them into needing your solution.
   - Read the following books:
     - Challenger sales
     - Never Split the difference

 - Prospecting
   - The most boring part of sales and the most important.
   - Sales prospecting and inbound marketing lead people into the funnel where you can actively close them.
     - Again this is for services.
   - A lot of this process can be outsourced because it is just generally low value work.
     - Upwork is a great place to find assistants to do so.
     - Also you need to keep a CRM to do this. Excel and Google Sheets doesnt work. Use Pipedrive. It is cheap and great.
   - Prospecting works like this:
     - Figure out who the buyer is and reach out to them with the pain that they have that you are solving.
     - I am not going to reach a financial company the same way i reach a health care company.
       - They may be similar in a lot of ways but they buyers concerns are much different.
   - System
     - You need a system to do prospecting otherwise you won't do it at all.
     - A weekly system where you reach out to 5 prospects of different personas. Seriously. Just start with 5. Even that if you've never done it will be nervewreacking.
     - A way of reaching out to prospects.
       - Use assistants or what not to do this work.
       - It takes a lot of time to do research and data entry.
         - But at the end of the day make sure you are the one that makes the call on who you are reaching out to, at the early stage.
       - Our system
         - 1. Have all entities go into our CRM.
         - 2. Have assistant go through those and enter information and change status
         - 3. I decide if those companies are who we should target. Persona / Anti-Persona and method of reaching out.
         - 4. Reach Out

   - A lot of it comes down to defining a buyer matrix.
     - For my business I focus on 3 different types of companies for my outreach because I see myself fitting in with that group
       - Health, Finance, Enterprise
     - Define a buyer matrix for each of them.
     - Each has a different concern even if they are the same.
     - Figure out the best way to reach them.
     - 80/20. Really hone in on the way that the persona looks for. If you can figure out the 20% that gives 80% of the value then that is great.

   - Just as important. Define an anti-persona.
     - These kinds of clients take up all your time.
     - They suck to work with
     - They prevent you from doing what you want to do.
     - There is no reward with a referral or otherwise later on. So honestly a non sales benefit.
       - Say you are not a fit. Most people want you to sell them. If you say hey we likely are not going to work well people are taken aback.
